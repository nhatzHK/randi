### Creating an issue 
  * Describe what happened?
  * Describe what you think was supposed to happen?
  * Can I realistically prevent this from happening? Is it under my control?
  * Why do you think the expected behaviour wasn't produced?
  * How do you think this issue can be solved?
  * Why do you think this feature should be added (feature request)?

### Creating a pull request
  * Is that feture really needed (feature addition)?
  * How much more complex will this make the code bade?
  * How did you implement this?
  * Do you use soft-tabs (4 spaces)? No? Hum well :|
  * Do you put a space between the function name and the pair of parentheses? No? Hum well :|
     ```python
     def foo ():
        print ("This is foo.")
        
     foo ()
     ```
     
  * Do you comment you code? No? Hum well :| (say why you did something a certain way, let the code say the how)
    ```python
    # Delete and recreate the instance because ...
    # Could be done ... but doing it like that ...
    def recreate (instance):
      delete (instance)
      return Instance.create_instance ()
    ```
  * Do you use `snake_case`? YES? YESSSSS!!!
  * Did you introduce new global variables? Well, we can talk about it :)
  * Are your lines longer than 80 charachters? Yes? Hum well :|
  * Do you put a space between operators and operands? Yes? Good! Always? Great!
  * Is your code ready for exceptionl cases?
  * Are your constants named with `ALL_UPPERCASE`?
  * Do you `import custom_module as NAMED` (import as and ALL UPPERCASE)
  * You can add to this any coding standard you usually apply for your own code.
  * Do you disagree with any of those? Well, we can talk about it.
